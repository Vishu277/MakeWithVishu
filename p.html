<h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2><p>Like most website operators, MakeWithVishu collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MakeWithVishu's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MakeWithVishu's visitors use its website. From time to time, MakeWithVishu may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>MakeWithVishu also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://vishu277.github.io/MakeWithVishu/# blog posts.
